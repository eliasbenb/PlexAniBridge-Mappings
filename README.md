# PlexAniBridge Mappings

Last generated at: February 21, 2025 04:52 AM UTC

This is an autogenerated list for mapping AniList IDs to AniDB IDs, MyAnimeList IDs, TVDb IDs, and IMDb IDs for use with [PlexAniBridge](https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge).

This list is generated daily at 12:00 AM UTC

## Format

This is an example mapping entry you would find in the [mappings.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kometa-Team/Anime-IDs/master/anime_ids.json) file.

```json
{
  "21234": {
    "anidb_id": 11292,
    "imdb_id": "tt5249462",
    "mal_id": 31043,
    "tmdb_show_id": 65249,
    "tvdb_epoffset": 0,
    "tvdb_id": 303071,
    "tvdb_season": 1
  }
}
```

- The main key of each entry is the AniList ID of the entry.
- `anidb_id`: This should link directly to the exact same anime on [AniDB.net](https://anidb.net).
- `imdb_id`: This should be the IMDb ID of the Series for shows and seasons, but should link directly to the IMDb ID of the Movie or Special if it is one. The field can also be an array of IMDb IDs if the show has multiple entries.
- `mal_id`: This should link directly to the exact same anime on [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net). The field can also be an array of MyAnimeList IDs if the Anime has multiple entries.
- `tmdb_movie_id`: This looks at the AniDB site under the resources for the anime.
- `tmdb_show_id`: This looks at the AniDB site under the resources for the anime.
- `tvdb_id`: This is always the Series ID that contains the show/season/movie/special. **This should never be a TVDb Movie ID or TVDb Season ID.**
- `tvdb_season`: This is the season number if the entry is a season.
- `tvdb_epoffset`: This is the episode offset if the entry is a season. An offset of 0 means the season starts at episode 1.
